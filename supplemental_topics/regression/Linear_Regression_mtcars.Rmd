## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Reminder, if you have not downloaded the package, use `install.packages("tidyverse")` first.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We'll use the mtcars dataset for this example. Let's take a look at the head of the data.
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

We can see all the column names using `colnames`.
```{r}
colnames(mtcars)
```

`str(mtcars)` will give additional information about the data set.
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

Finally, to examine the data set we can get the help information on it.
```{r}
?mtcars
```

Use scatterplots to examine the relationship between individual variables.

We will start by comparing qsec with mpg.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = qsec, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

Next, we will compare weight with mpg.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
Finally, let's compare carb with mpg.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = carb, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

Next, lets create a training and test data set from the data frame. We will use 
70% of the data to train with and 30% to test with.
```{r}
trainDataIndex = createDataPartition(mtcars$mpg, p=0.7, list = FALSE)
trainData = mtcars[trainDataIndex, ]
testData = mtcars[-trainDataIndex, ]
```

Next, we fit the model using the training dataset.
```{r}
model <- lm(mpg ~ carb + qsec + wt, data = trainData)
model
```

`summary` on the model will provide output on the metrics of the model.
```{r}
summary(model)
```

We can now use the model to predict with on the test data set.
```{r}
pred = predict(model, newdata = testData)
pred
testData$predictions = pred
```

Then, we can plot the predictions against actual values to see how well the model did.
```{r}
ggplot(testData, aes(x = mpg, y = predictions)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
