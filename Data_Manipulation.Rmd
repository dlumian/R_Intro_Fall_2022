## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

You can sort your data using the arrange function.  This will sort the data based on age in ascending order with the youngest patient being the first of the dataset.
```{r}
pbc_arrange <- arrange(pbc, age) 
pbc_arrange
```
You can also sort on descending order. You will again use age and this time the oldest patient will be the first.
```{r}
pbc_arrange <- arrange(pbc, desc(age))
pbc_arrange
```
This is a large dataset, let's say you want to subset the data to just the columns of information you need for your analysis. You can use the select function. Let's say you are interested in just the patient id, sex and age.
```{r}
pbc_select <- select(pbc, id, sex, age)
pbc_select
```
For reference you can use the "-" to select every column but the ones listed
```{r}
pbc_select <- select(pbc, -id, -sex, -age)
pbc_select
```
You may only be interested in the male patients for this dataset. You can use the filter function to select only rows where sex is equal to "m" for male.
```{r}
pbc_filter <- filter(pbc, sex=="m") 
pbc_filter
```
You can also filter based on if the patients are older than 70. 
```{r}
pbc_filter <- filter(pbc, age > 70)
pbc_filter
```
You may be interested in computing new information from your data. For instance the data in the ast column (aspartate aminotransferase), is in Units/ml (milliliter).  You can create a new column (called new_val here) that calculates Units/ul (microliter).

```{r}
pbc_mutate <- mutate(pbc, new_val=ast/1000) 
pbc_mutate
```
Once you have calculated new information in our table you may want to write the table to a file.  You can use the write.table function for this. The file will show up in the files tab to the right with the name "pbc_mutate".
```{r}
write.table(pbc_mutate,"pbc_mutate.txt",row.names=F,sep="\t")
```
You can use the summarize function to summarize the data in specific ways. Here you are outputting a table with mean age of the pbc patients.
```{r}
ave_age <-summarize(pbc, new_col = mean(age))
ave_age
```
You can also group the data based on a specified variable or group of variables.
```{r}
group_by_sex <- group_by(pbc,sex)
group_by_sex
```
Interestingly nothing changes about the data that can be seen in the table. You can use the groups function to look at how the data is. You can always use View(pbc) to look at the original dataset. 
```{r}
groups(group_by_sex)
groups(pbc)
```
Group by is particularly helpful when used in conjunction other functions such as the previously used summarize function.  You can combine the group by and summarize function to calculate the mean age of males versus females. You could do this in two steps but you don't need the intermediate data so a pipe "%>%" can be used. A pipe is like saying do this then immediately follow with this next function.
```{r}
pbc_final <- pbc %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(new_col = mean(age))
pbc_final
```
