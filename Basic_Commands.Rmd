## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


You can embed an R code chunk like below.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

### Addition
```{r}
2 + 1
```

Below are several more chunks you can run to make R perform basic math operations.

### Subtraction
```{r}
2 - 1 
```

### Multiplication
```{r}
2 * 1 
```

### Division
```{r}
2 / 1 
```

### Exponentiation
```{r}
2 ** 2
```

### Multiple Operations
```{r}
1 + 1
2 - 1
2 / 2
3 * 3
4 ** 4
```

## Assigning Variables
Variables can be assigned and used in R.

It can be helpful to represent objects as variables instead of their full details.

The next examples are trivial but will be expanded on later in the session.

### Assigning Variables
```{r}
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
```

Notice, no output is generated by assigning a variable.
However, they are now stored in memory and can be used.

### Multiple operations with variables
```{r}
a + a
b - a
b / b
c * c
d ** d
```

Notice here, our results are identical to the cell above which just used numbers.

Variables are mutable, that is they can be changed. 

### Updating a variable
```{r}
a = a + 1
print(a)
```
The above chunk uses a built-in function `print` which displays the given input.

## Vectors
In R, it is common work with large amounts of data. Data can be stored in various
formats. One basic data type is a vector.

### Creating a vector
```{r}
vector_1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(vector_1)
```
Here, we again use a built-in function `c` which stands for combine.

### Single Vector Operations

In reseach and data science we often want to perform operations on vectors of data.

For example, we may want to sum the vector or find the mean of it.

R has handy built-in functions for these types of operations.

### Descriptives of a vector
```{r}
sum(vector_1)
mean(vector_1)
min(vector_1)
max(vector_1)
```

### Vector from variables
```{r}
vector_2 = c(a, b, c, d)
print(vector_2)
```
It looks like vector_1 and vector_2 do not match because a was modified above.

We will use the `setequal` function to compare them.
This function takes two arguements and will return TRUE if they are equal else FALSE.

### Comparing vectors
```{r}
setequal(vector_1, vector_2)
```

Let's alter vector_2 so that they match.

### Updating a value in an vector
```{r}
vector_2[1]=1
print(vector_2)
```

To compare two vectors in R, we again use `setequal`. 

### Comparing vectors
```{r}
setequal(vector_1, vector_2)
```
Here we can see that the two vectors are equal.

R can perform vector math as well. Here we will create a third vector adding
vector_1 and vector_2.

### Assigning value to item in vector
```{r}
vector_3 = vector_1 + vector_2
```

Notice, there is no output! This is because we assigned the result into a new variable.

Let's print out vector_3 and see the result.
```{r}
print(vector_3)
```

### More vector operations
```{r}
vector_1 - vector_2
vector_1 * vector_2
vector_1 / vector_2
vector_1 ** vector_2
```

## Manipulating multiple vectors

### Concatenating vectors

Vectors can be combined to create longer vectors using the `c` command.

```{r}
vector_4 = c(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3)
print(vector_4)
```

### DataFrames
Multiple vectors can be combined into dataframes.

Use the commands `rbind` combine vectors as rows.

```{r}
df1 = rbind(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3)
print(df1)
```

Use the commands `cbind` combine vectors as columns.
```{r}
df2 = cbind(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3)
print(df2)
```

This concludes the introduction to basic commands in R!
