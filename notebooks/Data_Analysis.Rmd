## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Basic Statistics

R is a great tool for statistics as well. Here we will explore a few basic analysis options.
- Correlation
  + Measure of how well two variables hang together
  + Ranges from 1 to -1
- t-tests
  + Compares means of two groups
Note, R has many more advanced statistical analyses, these are just two simple examples.

```{r}
cor.test(pbc$copper, pbc$albumin)
```

Let's visualize the relationship!
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=copper, y=albumin)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

Next, lets create two vectors for an independent samples t-test.
We will compare males and females on age. 

```{r}
male_ages = pbc$age[pbc$sex=='m']
female_ages = pbc$age[pbc$sex=='f']
t.test(male_ages, female_ages)
```

Let's visualize the results with a bar graph.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=sex, y=age)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun.y="mean")
```
Add error bars to the plot!
Begin by calculating mean and standard deviation.
```{r}
age_barplot_data <- pbc %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(age_M = mean(age), age_SD = sd(age))
age_barplot_data
```
Create the plot with the new dataset.
```{r}
ggplot(age_barplot_data, aes(x=sex, y=age_M, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(data = age_barplot_data, 
      aes(ymin = age_M - age_SD, ymax = age_M + age_SD, y = age_M),
        position = position_dodge(width = .9))
```
