## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note: if you have not installed the finalfit library, use `install.packages("corrplot")`.
```{r cars}
library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
```

# Basic Statistics

R is a great tool for statistics as well. Here we will explore a few basic analysis options.
- Correlation
  + Measure of how well two variables hang together
  + Ranges from 1 to -1
- t-tests
  + Single group t-test
  + Independent samples t-test
  + Paired samples t-test
Note, R has many more advanced statistical analyses, these are just a few simple examples.


## mtcars data
We will use several different data frames for this session as various data formats are needed.
Including the introduction of the `mtcars` data frame.

Let's start by exploring the data.
```{r}
mtcars
```
Use the below code to see what the columns represent in the help pane.
```{r}
?mtcars
```
Get an idea of how the data is stored and descriptives of each column.
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Correlation
Correlations range from 1 to -1. A correlation coefficient of 1 means the two variables 
track perfectly in a positive direction. -1 represents two variables that are 
inversely related to each other (as one goes up the other goes down).

Use the `cor` command on a data frame to get the correlations of all numeric columns
in the data frame.
Note: the diagnol should always be 1 as each variable should correlate perfectly with itself.
Note: The data in the matrix is redundant. The top half and bottom half show the same
relationships.
```{r}
car_corr = cor(mtcars)
car_corr
```

It can be very helpful to visualize the correlations. Here we use the `corrplot` command
from the corrplot package.
THe darker the color, the stronger the correlation. Red represents negative 
correlations while blue is used for positive correlations.
```{r}
corrplot(car_corr, method="number", type="lower")
```
To get more details on a single correlation and to test it's significance, 
use the `cor.test` command. 
```{r}
cor.test(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```
This shows a significant correlation (p value less than .05).

Let's visualize the relationship!
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=hp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

## t-tests

### Single sample t-test

For a single sample t-test, a vector of numeric numbers is tested against a known value (mu).
The test determines if the vector differs from the set/known value.

Let's take a look at the weight of the cars in the dataset with a histogram to begin.

```{r}
hist(mtcars$wt)
```
It looks like the distribution centers around 3, so let's test the weights against the value of 3.

```{r}
t.test(mtcars$wt, mu=3)
```
Here, we see that the values do not differ from 3 (p-value greater than .05).
This makes sense since we chose a mu that based on the data.

In the real-world, this type of analysis may be useful to see if a sample differs
from a known population value. For example, if the height residents of a country differ
from the known global average. 

### Two samples independent t-test
A two samples independent t-test is used to compare two vectors and see if they come
from the same sample.

For this example, we will compare V-shaped engines with straight engines on mpg.

Here we can see that the column `vs` has two levels, 0 and 1.
```{r}
unique(mtcars$vs)
```
Let's also find out how many of each type there are.

```{r}
table(mtcars$vs)
```

There are two ways to run the t-test. We can specify a numeric column and a binary
identifier column for groups or we can use two numeric vectors. 

Both methods will be demonstrated here, although they should yeild identical results.

```{r}
t.test(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$vs)
```
We see from the results, that there is a significant difference in mpg based on engine type.
The means at the bottom tell us the average for each type.

Next, remember that you can subset data using a condition and column selection.
We will create two vectors, one for each engine type and re-run the analysis.
This is for demonstration purposes, you can choose either option and get the same results.

```{r}
v_mpg = mtcars[mtcars$vs==0, "mpg"]
v_mpg
s_mpg = mtcars[mtcars$vs==1, "mpg"]
s_mpg
t.test(v_mpg, s_mpg)
```
Notice, the results are identical. This just demonstrates that the test can be run
with data in various formats.

Let's visualize the results with a bar graph.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=vs, y=mpg)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun="mean")
```
Add error bars to the plot!
Begin by calculating mean and standard deviation.
```{r}
mpg_barplot_data <- mtcars %>% group_by(vs) %>% summarize(mpg_M = mean(mpg), mpg_SD = sd(mpg))
mpg_barplot_data
```
Create the plot with the new dataset.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg_barplot_data, aes(x=vs, y=mpg_M, fill=vs)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(data = mpg_barplot_data, 
      aes(ymin = mpg_M - mpg_SD, ymax = mpg_M + mpg_SD, y = mpg_M),
        position = position_dodge(width = .9))
```

### ChickWeight Data

We need another dataset to run a paired samples t-test. So we will load the
ChickWeight data set. We will start by examining the data and reshaping it.
Then we will run a paired samples t-test.

```{r}
head(ChickWeight)
```

See the help for definitions of each column.
```{r}
?ChickWeight
```

Use the summary function to get an idea of the data in each column.
```{r}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

We want to reshape the data so we can easily pull each day from its own column.

We use the `reshape` method to turn the data from long to wide format.
```{r}
ChickWeightWide = reshape(ChickWeight, idvar = c("Chick", "Diet"), timevar = "Time", direction="wide")
ChickWeightWide
```

Missing data will throw off the analysis, so we want to check for missing data.
```{r}
any(is.na(ChickWeightWide))
sum(is.na(ChickWeightWide))
```
We see that there are 22 missing data points. 

We use the `complete.cases` function to drop rows with missing data.
```{r}
ChickWeightWide = ChickWeightWide[complete.cases(ChickWeightWide), ]
ChickWeightWide
```
Note, we lost 5 rows of data due to missing data.

### Paired Samples t-test
We can now compare the first and second time points.
```{r}
t.test(ChickWeightWide$weight.0, ChickWeightWide$weight.2, paired = TRUE)
```
We can plot the average weight at each point and see that, as we might expect, weight
goes up at each subsequent timepoint.

```{r}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x=Time, y=weight, fill=Time)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun="mean")
```
This concludes the introduction to analysis in R!
