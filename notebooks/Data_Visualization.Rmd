## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
```
### Get current working directory
```{r}
getwd()
```
## Create a directory for output of images
```{r}
img_path = "../images"
dir.create(img_path)
```

# Data Visualization with ggplot

Plotting a single discrete variable(sex) as a bar plot.  Here the y-axis is the number of patients that are male versus female.

Let's calculate the numbers we expect before generating the plot.
```{r}
age_count = pbc %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(age_cnt = length(age))
age_count
```
Now, let's plot the data.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=sex)) + geom_bar()
```

Plotting a single continuous variable (age) as a histogram. Here the y-axis is the number of patients in each age bin.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram()
```

ggplot gives a warning that the default binwidth may not be the most suitable for our data.  We can specific binwidth by adding it to the histogram function options.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=5)
```

Histograms are easier to create when the underlying data distribution is already known, making it harder to use for exploration.  It is also a count based method so comparing across data sets of differing numbers would be difficult. A density plot is similar to a histogram. 
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(age)) + geom_density()
```

Plotting discrete (sex) and continuous (age) variables as a boxplot plot.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x= sex, y=age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Plotting two continuous variables (age and platelet count) as a scatter plot.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x = age, y = platelet)) + geom_point()
```

Revisiting the layering concept, we can add a regression line to our previous plot by just adding that function to the previous command.  We want to plot a linear regression so we need to specify that in the method option. 
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x = age, y = platelet)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

We can create a scatter plot with age versus platelet count and add color to the points based on sex.  This will also be passed to the regression line so there will now be a separate regression line for male and female.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=age, y=platelet, color=sex)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

The points and lines overlap to some degree so it is difficult to see if there are any differences.  We can instead automatically generate a graph for each value in a discrete variable using the facet wrap function.
```{r}
ggplot(pbc, aes(x=age, y=platelet)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) + facet_wrap(vars(sex), nrow=1)
```

Let's say we want to create density plots for all of the clinical data to get a quick look at data distribution.  We could utilize the facet wrap command but first we would need to reshape our data to a long format.  Right now the data is in a wide format in which each patient is a single row with each clinical and phenotypic variables in a separate column. We can select the id, sex, and continuous clinical variables and then use gather to move all of these variables minus sex and id into a singular key column with the corresponding value in a value column. 
```{r}
pbc_long <- pbc %>% select(id,sex,bili:platelet) %>% gather(key, value, -sex, -id)
pbc_long
```
Once we have reshaped our data in this format we can plot all of the continuous variables as density plots in a single command. 
```{r}
ggplot(pbc_long , aes(value)) + geom_density() + facet_wrap(vars(key), scales = "free") 
```

We can save the last ggplot we created with the ggsave function.
```{r}
ggsave(file.path(img_path, "facet_density.png"))
```

This concludes the intro to Data Visualization in R!
