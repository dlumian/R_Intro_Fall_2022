## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


You can embed an R code chunk like below.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(survival)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Saving data to local file
To start with, we will load a built-in dataset, pbc from the survival package.

We will then manipulate the data, adding a column, and save the data.

Data will be exported in multiple formats to show R capabilities.

A `data` folder has been created for you to save the files in to help keep the 
repo orgranized.
```{r}
pbc
```
Now let's add a column to the data.
```{r}
pbc_mutate <- mutate(pbc, new_val=ast/1000) 
pbc_mutate
```

Before writing out the table, let's figure out where we are in the repo.
```{r}
getwd()
```
The output shows we are in the notebooks folder. So we will have to go up a directory
and then down into the data folder to save to the correct location.

Once you have calculated new information in our table you may want to write the table to a file.  You can use the write.table function for this.

The file will show up in the files tab to the right with the name `data/pbc_mutate.txt`.
```{r}
write.table(pbc_mutate,"../data/pbc_mutate.txt",row.names=F,sep="\t")
```

We can also save the data into a csv format. The syntax will be similar.
```{r}
write.csv(pbc_mutate,"../data/pbc_mutate.csv",row.names=F)
```

## Read data in from local file

We will now read the data we saved back into R. 

Let's start with the text table saved first.
```{r}
pbc_mutate_txt = read.table("../data/pbc_mutate.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
pbc_mutate_txt
```

Next, let's load the csv data back into r with a new variable name.
```{r}
pbc_mutate_csv = read.csv("../data/pbc_mutate.csv", header = TRUE)
pbc_mutate_csv
```

Now that we have two dataframes loaded, let's check if they are the same.
```{r}
identical(pbc_mutate_txt, pbc_mutate_csv)
```
This shows that even though we saved the data in two formats, when we read the 
data back into R, the dataframes are identical. So how you save your data is up
to your preference, as long as you specify the correct parameters when saving
and importing the data.

## Reading data from a website
We can load precomputed data directly from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
) (the gene expression omnibus).  Let's use RNAseq data from 3 adult and 4 embryonic mouse cerebral cortex samples.  This dataset (GSE39866) was generated to track transcriptomic changes during brain development. The R package deseq2 was used to normalize and then calculate differential expression for this dataset.
```{r}
vst <-read_tsv("ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE39nnn/GSE39866/suppl/GSE39866_Mouse.VarianceStabilized.Datagene.txt.gz")
vst
```
This concludes the data import/export module.
