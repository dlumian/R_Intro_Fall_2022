## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


You can embed an R code chunk like below.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

### Addition
```{r}
2 + 1
```
Notice the output is displayed below the code chunk.

Below are several more chunks you can run to make R perform basic math operations.

### Subtraction
```{r}
2 - 1 
```

### Multiplication
```{r}
2 * 1 
```

### Division
```{r}
2 / 1 
```

### Exponentiation
```{r}
2 ** 2
```

### Multiple Operations
```{r}
1 + 1
2 - 1
2 / 2
3 * 3
4 ** 4
```

## Assigning Variables
Variables can be assigned and used in R.

It can be helpful to represent objects as variables instead of with their full details.

The next examples are trivial but will be expanded upon later in the session.

### Assigning Variables
```{r}
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
```

Notice, no output is generated by assigning a variable.
However, they are now stored in memory and can be used.

### Multiple operations with variables
```{r}
a + a
b - a
b / b
c * c
d ** d
```

Notice here, our results are identical to the cell above which just used numbers.

Variables are mutable, that is they can be changed. 

### Updating a variable
```{r}
a = a + 1
print(a)
```
The above chunk uses a built-in function `print` which displays the given input.

## Vectors
In R, it is common work with large amounts of data. Data can be stored in various formats. One basic data type is a vector.

### Creating a vector
```{r}
vector_1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(vector_1)
```
Here, we again use a built-in function `c` which stands for combine.

### Single Vector Operations

In research and data science we often want to perform operations on vectors of data.

For example, we may want to sum the vector or find the mean of it.

R has handy built-in functions for these types of operations.

### Descriptives of a vector
```{r}
sum(vector_1)
mean(vector_1)
min(vector_1)
max(vector_1)
```

### Vector from variables
```{r}
vector_2 = c(a, b, c, d)
print(vector_2)
```
It looks like vector_1 and vector_2 do not match because `a` was modified above.

We will use the `setequal` function to compare them.
This function takes two arguments and will return `TRUE` if they are equal else `FALSE`.

To learn more about the function, we can run `?setequal` and see if help info is available.

### Help function
```{r}
?setequal
```


### Comparing vectors
```{r}
setequal(vector_1, vector_2)
```

Let's alter vector_2 so that they match.

### Updating a value in an vector
```{r}
vector_2[1]=1
print(vector_2)
```

To compare two vectors in R, we again use `setequal`. 

### Comparing vectors
```{r}
setequal(vector_1, vector_2)
```
Here we can see that the two vectors are equal.

R can perform vector math as well. Here we will create a third vector adding vector_1 and vector_2.

### Vector addition
```{r}
vector_3 = vector_1 + vector_2
```

Notice, there is no output! This is because we assigned the result into a new variable.

Let's print out vector_3 and see the result.
```{r}
print(vector_3)
```

### More vector operations
```{r}
vector_1 - vector_2
vector_1 * vector_2
vector_1 / vector_2
vector_1 ** vector_2
```

## Manipulating multiple vectors

### Concatenating vectors

Vectors can be combined to create longer vectors using the `c` command.

```{r}
vector_4 = c(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3)
print(vector_4)
```

### DataFrames
Multiple vectors can be combined into data frames.

Use the command `rbind` to combine vectors as rows.

```{r}
df1 = rbind(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3)
print(df1)
```

Use the command `cbind` to combine vectors as columns.

```{r}
df2 = cbind(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3)
print(df2)
```

### Column and row names

Now that the data is in a multidimensional array, R has assigned row and col names.

We can access those names using `colnames()` and `rownames()`.
```{r}
colnames(df2)
rownames(df2)
```
Notice, NULL is returned as the row names. This is because they have not been set yet.

To get R to automatically assign row names add the argument `do.NULL=FALSE`.

To learn more about this argument you can run `?rownames`.
```{r}
colnames(df2)
rownames(df2, do.NULL=FALSE)
```

It can often be helpful to supply row and column names.

See the next chunk for how to do so.

```{r}
colnames(df2) = c("Col1", "Col2", "Col3")
rownames(df2) = c("Row1", "Row2", "Row3", "Row4")
```
Notice, no output is produced. Lets try printing the dataframe to see if our changes worked.

```{r}
colnames(df2)
rownames(df2)
```

This concludes the introduction to basic commands in R!
